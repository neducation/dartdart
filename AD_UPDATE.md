# Ad System Update - Button & Playback Fix

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. **Ad Indicator/Button System**

Before users see the ad video, they now see:

- **üì∫ Advertisement icon** - Large TV emoji with pulsing animation
- **"Advertisement" text** - Clear label
- **Green "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Watch Ad" button** - Primary action with hover effects
- **Gray "‚úï Skip" button** - Secondary option to skip

### 2. **Improved Video Playback**

Fixed video playback issues:

- Added proper video loading with `onloadeddata` handler
- Enabled video controls as fallback for autoplay restrictions
- Set `muted = false` for audio playback
- Added mobile playback attributes (`webkit-playsinline`, `x5-playsinline`)
- Better error handling with console logging
- Small delay before play() to ensure video is ready

### 3. **User Flow**

```
Ad Triggers ‚Üí Ad Indicator Screen ‚Üí User Clicks "Watch Ad" ‚Üí Video Plays ‚Üí Close/End ‚Üí Continue Game
                ‚Üì (skip option)
                Continue Game
```

### 4. **Visual Design**

- **Ad Icon**: Blue gradient card with pulsing glow animation
- **Play Button**: Green gradient with shadow, grows on hover
- **Skip Button**: Gray/neutral styling for secondary action
- **Video Player**: Full controls visible, max 90vw x 70vh
- **Close Button**: Red themed, appears during video playback

## üéÆ Testing Instructions

### Test Ad on Wave Completion:

1. Start any level
2. Complete 5 waves
3. See the ad indicator with TV icon
4. Click "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Watch Ad" to play
5. Video should play with controls
6. Click "‚úï Close Ad" or wait for video to end

### Test Ad on Refresh:

1. Refresh page (1st time - no ad)
2. Refresh again (2nd time - ad shows!)
3. See ad indicator
4. Click "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Watch Ad" or "‚úï Skip"

### Debug Console:

Watch for these logs:

- "Playing ad: ./assets/ads/adX.mp4"
- "Ad video loaded successfully"
- "Ad playing successfully"

If errors appear:

- "Ad video error" - Check file path/format
- "Failed to play ad" - Browser autoplay restriction (controls will show)

## üìÅ Your Ad Files

Confirmed uploaded in `assets/ads/`:

- ‚úÖ ad1.mp4
- ‚úÖ ad2.mp4
- ‚úÖ ad3.mp4
- ‚úÖ ad4.mp4

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Video not playing?

1. **Check browser console** for error messages
2. **Try clicking play** on the video controls (shown as fallback)
3. **Check file format**: Should be H.264 MP4
4. **Check file size**: Under 10MB recommended
5. **Verify path**: Files must be exactly in `assets/ads/` folder

### Ad showing but no video?

- Browser may require user interaction before playing
- Controls are now shown as fallback - user can click play
- Error handling will alert and skip if file doesn't load
