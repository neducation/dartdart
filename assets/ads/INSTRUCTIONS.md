# How to Add Your Ad Videos

## Step 1: Prepare Your Videos

- Convert your ads to MP4 format
- Recommended resolution: 1280x720 or 1920x1080
- Keep file size under 10MB each for fast loading
- Suggested length: 5-30 seconds

## Step 2: Upload Videos

Place your MP4 files in this folder with these exact names:

```
assets/ads/
  ├── ad1.mp4
  ├── ad2.mp4
  ├── ad3.mp4
  └── ad4.mp4
```

## Step 3: Test

The ad system will:

- Show a random ad every 5 waves completed
- Show a random ad every 2 page refreshes
- Always display a close button
- Auto-close when video ends

## Fallback

If video files are not found, the ad will automatically close after 1 second and the game continues normally.

## Current Status

⚠️ No ad videos uploaded yet. Upload your MP4 files to enable the ad system.
